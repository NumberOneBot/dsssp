## React Library for Audio Processing

This is a React component library for visualizing and managing audio filters. These components are designed to serve as the core UI elements of audio editing tools and interfaces, enabling users to interactively configure all filter parameters. Essentially, it is a conversion of proprietary audio processing and visualization tools from professional desktop software to a web-based environment.

The library's rendering system is based on SVG and provides a logarithmic frequency graph for audio spectrum representation, a set of components to render and manipulate biquad filters, and mathematical functions to calculate the resulting signal curve. Filters support drag-and-drop interactions, direct property updates (**gain**, **frequency**, **Q-factor**), and implement common audio filter [types](?path=/docs/foundations-filters--docs).
