## React Library for Audio Processing and Visualization

This is a React component library to visualize frequency response graphs and control audio filters. It provides core UI elements for audio editing tools, allowing users to adjust filter parameters interactively. Essentially, it is a conversion of proprietary audio processing and visualization tools from professional desktop software to a web-based environment.

The library's rendering system is based on SVG and provides a logarithmic frequency graph for audio spectrum representation, a set of components to render and manipulate biquad filters, and mathematical functions to calculate the resulting signal curve. Filters support drag-and-drop interactions, direct property updates (**gain**, **frequency**, **Q-factor**), and implement common audio filter [types](?path=/docs/foundations-audio-filters--docs).
