# Foundations

## Themes

The library offers two levels of customization: **themes** and **configuration props** for individual components.

Theme object provides a centralized way to manage the look and feel of all components: Frequency Response Graph, Filters, Curves and Gradients. <br/>
Think of it as **the one ring to rule them all** in your theming hierarchy. While individual Filter Components have their own properties for colors, sizes, and other visual aspects, these should be primarily used for fine-tuning and overrides.

The `GraphTheme` object, when passed as a property to the `FrequencyResponseGraph` component, merges with the default theme. This allows you to modify specific visual elements without redefining the entire theme structure. The same behavior applies to the `GraphScale` property, which controls the graph's [scaling](?path=/docs/container-frequencyresponsegraph--docs) parameters.

#### Structure of the Default Theme

<Source dark code={ThemeSourceCode.split("\n").slice(2).join("\n")} language="javascript" />

Since each application may require a different number of filters, the `filters.colors` array in the built-in theme is empty by design. You'll need to populate it with your color values - check out the [next section](?path=/docs/foundations-colors--docs) to learn more.

TypeScript developers can use the `GraphThemeOverride` type when customizing theme parameters. This type ensures that only valid predefined keys and values can be used,  safeguarding against typos.

```jsx
import { type GraphThemeOverride } from 'dsssp'

const customTheme: GraphThemeOverride = {
  background: {
    gradient: {
      start: '#333333',
      stop: '#000000',
      extraKey: 'value' // TypeScript Error: Object literal may only specify known properties
    }
  }
}

// ...

<FrequencyResponseGraph theme={customTheme} />
```
