## Theme

Theme JSON object is a unified way to manage the look and feel of the Frequency Response Graph, Filters and Curves. Consider it as a one place to rule them all. Filter Components also have a bunch of their own properties to control colors, sizes and other visual aspects, but they should be mostly used for fine-tuning and overrides.
